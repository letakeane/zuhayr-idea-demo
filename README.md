# React app

A basic idea-saving app. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
1. Change into the directory: `cd zuhayr-idea-demo`
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
1. Start the server: `npm start`

When finished developing, make sure to end the server process!!! Do not just close out.

End the process in the terminal by holding the `ctrl` button (NOT the command button) and hitting `C`.
